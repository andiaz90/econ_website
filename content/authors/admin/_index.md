I am an Economist at the [Central Bank of Chile](https://www.bcentral.cl). I received my PhD in Economics from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/).

My research focuses on **consumption insurance**, **fertility dynamics**, and **labor market behavior**. I study how households respond to economic shocks and policy changes, with particular attention to the role of cognitive skills, financial constraints, and intergenerational transfers.
