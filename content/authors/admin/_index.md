I am an Economist at the Economic Modeling Department of the Central Bank of Chile, where I contribute to macroeconomic analysis and policy research. I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania (2023).

My research interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics, labor economics, and family economics. My work examines consumption insurance, fertility dynamics, and labor market behavior, with a focus on understanding how households make decisions in response to economic shocks and policy changes.
