abstract: "This paper studies how cognitive skills shape the timing of first birth and quantifies the mechanisms behind the steep ability gradient in teen childbearing. In the NLSY79, by ages 14-17, 28% of women in the bottom AFQT quartile have a first birth versus 3% in the top quartile, and mean age at first birth differs by 5.4 years. I estimate a dynamic life-cycle model in which schooling, marriage, labor supply, and contraceptive effort are jointly chosen. The model matches the difference in teen birth and shows that opportunity costs alone are insufficient: allowing ability to raise the effectiveness of contraceptive effort is key for fit. Counterfactuals imply large effects of improved fertility control: equalizing contraception frictions to those faced by high-ability teens reduces pregnancies before age 18 by 52.7% and increases college attendance by 19.8%; aligning both contraception and schooling opportunities raises college attendance by 45.2% and reduces early pregnancies by 60.0%. Welfare gains from improved fertility control are concentrated among low-ability women."
