abstract: "This paper asks whether standard education- and opportunity-cost mechanisms can explain the steep cognitive-skill gradient in early fertility, and what the answer implies for policies targeting teen childbearing and human-capital accumulation. In the NLSY79, the probability of a first birth by ages 14–17 is 28% in the bottom AFQT quartile versus 3% in the top quartile, and mean age at first birth differs by 5.4 years. I estimate a dynamic life-cycle model in which women jointly choose schooling, labor supply and experience accumulation, marriage, and contraceptive effort under imperfect fertility control. A nested specification that restricts ability to operate only through education, wage profiles, and marriage-market incentives cannot reproduce the observed teen-birth gradient. Matching the data requires a direct role for ability in effective fertility control: higher ability increases the effectiveness of contraceptive effort in reducing conception risk. Counterfactuals imply large effects of improved fertility control: equalizing contraception frictions to those faced by high-ability teens reduces pregnancies before age 18 by 52.7% and increases college attendance by 19.8%; aligning both contraception and schooling opportunities to the high-ability environment raises college attendance by 45.2% and reduces pregnancies before age 18 by 60.0%. Welfare gains from improved fertility control are concentrated among low-ability women."

summary: "How do cognitive skills shape fertility timing? I estimate a life-cycle model showing that contraception frictions, not just opportunity costs, drive the ability gradient in teen childbearing."
