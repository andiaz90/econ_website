abstract: Women in the lowest cognitive ability decile have nine times more teen pregnancies than those in the top decile. In this paper, I provide empirical evidence using NLSY79 data about the importance of cognitive ability on pregnancy timing and intention. Next, I build and estimate a life cycle model to analyze whether higher opportunity costs and higher contraception efficiency by education explain the differences in fertility timing between high and low ability women. These mechanisms explain only half of the correlation between ability and teen pregnancy. In order to explain the data, I allow for heterogeneity in contraception efficiency by cognitive ability. Finally,  I use the model to show that policies that decrease contraception costs decrease early pregnancies and improve women's welfare but do not improve teen mothers' college attendance, as college is too costly for this group of women, even without a teen pregnancy.
