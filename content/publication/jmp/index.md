abstract: "Teen childbearing varies sharply with cognitive skill: in a nationally representative U.S. cohort, 28% of women in the bottom quartile of an adolescent cognitive test had a first birth by ages 14–17, compared with 3% in the top quartile. I estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of schooling, work, marriage, and contraceptive effort to ask whether standard opportunity-cost channels can explain this gap. They cannot: matching the teen-birth gradient requires that cognitive skill also raises the effectiveness of contraceptive effort in reducing pregnancy risk. This finding introduces a novel mechanism to the structural fertility literature—ability-dependent contraceptive effectiveness—that operates beyond the channels in Choi (2017) and Ejrnæs and Jørgensen (2020). Counterfactuals imply that equalizing contraception access to high-skill levels lowers pregnancies before age 18 by 50% and raises college attendance by 13%. Welfare gains exceed 11% of lifetime consumption for the bottom ability quartile and are concentrated among low-skill women."

summary: "How do cognitive skills shape fertility timing? I estimate a life-cycle model showing that contraception frictions, not just opportunity costs, drive the ability gradient in teen childbearing."
