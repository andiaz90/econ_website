abstract: This paper examines how parent-child interactions and altruism affect college financial support and outcomes. I analyze how parents adjust their consumption levels when their children's wealth changes and how children's consumption shocks affect parent consumption. I use a dynastic overlapped generations model to explore how future transfers from parents to children influence college graduation rates. I find that parent transfer reduces the cost of college but also lowers college returns. Altruism increases college graduation rates for low-ability children with wealthy parents but decreases rates for high-ability children with poor parents. Parental altruism explains most of the college graduation gap between low-ability children with wealthy and poor parents. Understanding parent-child interactions and altruism is crucial for comprehending college investment decisions and outcomes.
