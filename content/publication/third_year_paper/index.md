abstract: This paper investigates the effect of parent-child interactions and altruism on investment decisions and outcomes in higher education. First, I document how parents adjust their consumption levels when their children are relatively richer or poorer than them. Second, children's consumption shocks also affect parent consumption. Next, I build and estimate an altruistically linked overlapping generation model with endogenous college decisions and incomplete markets to analyze how future transfers from parents to children shape college graduation. I show that parent transfer decreases the cost of college but also reduces college return, as children know their parents would support them in case of low consumption. Parent altruism increases college graduation rates by 80\% among low-ability children with parents in the highest wealth quartile. However, it decreases college graduation rates among high-ability children with parents in the lowest wealth quartile by 18\%, as the benefit of consumption insurance is higher than the incentives provided by their parents to attend college. Finally, parent altruism explains 86\% of the college graduation gap between low-ability children with parents in the highest wealth quartile compared to children with parents in the bottom wealth quartile. These findings underscore the importance of considering parent-child interactions and altruism in understanding college investment decisions and outcomes in higher education.
