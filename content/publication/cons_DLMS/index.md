abstract: We explore the properties of the consumption pass-through estimator proposed by Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2014) (HSV) using simulated data from a standard incomplete-markets model with labor supply decision. We show that the HSV wage-to-consumption pass-through estimator has an upward bias in the presence of precautionary savings while accurately capturing consumption insurance via labor supply adjustment when the savings motive is switched off. In our calibrated model at age 1, the bias is 8%, increasing as individuals accumulate wealth to 23% at age 70. The estimator is highly sensitive to deviations from the unit root assumption that underlies the HSV method; the bias is 33% and 55% for persistence of .99 and .98, respectively. Compared to the estimate of Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) (BPP), HSV performs better when agents are borrowing constraints, while BPP performs better than HSV as they move away from the constrain. The findings suggest that combining the two methods, such as using HSV for agents close to the borrowing constraints while applying BPP to agents away from the borrowing constraints, may yield more comprehensive consumption insurance estimates.
