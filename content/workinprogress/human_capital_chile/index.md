abstract: We analyze the general equilibrium effects of human capital misallocation in Chile. First, we utilize tax and educational records to estimate the proportion of educationally mismatched individuals (high-ability individuals with low educational attainment). Second, we estimate the labor market returns on ability, education, and human capital investment. Finally, we construct and calibrate a dynastic overlapping generations model with both private and public human capital investment to decompose the causes of educational mismatch and the general equilibrium effects of changes in sorting.
